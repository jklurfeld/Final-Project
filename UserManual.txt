My project was making a self balancing binary tree. To use my project, run the AVLTreeDriver.java file, and it will ask you
what number you want at the root. Input an integer and then press enter. A window showing the visualization will then pop up
showing the root node. Then, the options menu will show up in the command line showing what you can do next.

Options Menu:
    - insert: inserts a node into the tree (because the tree is self balancing, the tree will rotate by itself if needed)
    - delete: deletes a node from the tree (because the tree is self balancing, the tree will rotate by itself if needed)
    - sort: prints out a list of the nodes in the tree in numerical ascending order
    - print options: prints out the options menu
    - print tree: prints out a string representation of the tree, for each node the first number is the data, the second number
    is the balance factor, the third number is the height, and the fourth and fifth numbers are the x and y coordinates
    - quit: quits the program (note that the program is not fully quit out of until you close the window visualizing the tree, and
    another way to quit the program is to close the visualization pop up window)
